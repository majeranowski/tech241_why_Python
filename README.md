* Machine Learning - scikit-learn, TensorFlow makes Python preferable language for machine learning and AI
* Automation and Scripting - for DevOps role
* Scientific Computing - SciPy, NumPy used for scientific research

### Who is using Python?

A lot of companies and organizations like: 
* Google (Web Dev, infrastructure management etc.)
* Facebook (Back End)
* Netflix (reccomendations algorithms etc.)

and many more...

### Why is Python in such a demand?

As mentioned before we had many factors why Python is so popular.
It is mostly because its versatility. We can work with Python in Web Dev, DevOps, Data Analysis, AI.
It is also easy to learn and constantly evolving.

### Salaries:

Salaries have a big range. For DevOps average is around 90k USD. For ML and AI it can go up to 170k.

### OOP

OOP stands for Object-Oriented Programming, and Python is an object-oriented programming language that supports the principles and concepts of OOP. In object-oriented programming, the focus is on creating and designing objects that encapsulate data (attributes) and behavior (methods) together. These objects are instances of classes, which act as blueprints or templates for creating objects.

In Python, you can define classes to create your own custom data types. A class defines the attributes and methods that the objects of that class will have. Here's a simple example:

```python
class Car:
    def __init__(self, brand, model):
        self.brand = brand
        self.model = model

    def start_engine(self):
        print(f"The {self.brand} {self.model} engine has started.")

    def drive(self):
        print(f"Driving the {self.brand} {self.model}.")

# Creating objects/instances of the Car class
my_car = Car("Toyota", "Corolla")
your_car = Car("Honda", "Civic")

# Accessing attributes and calling methods of objects
print(my_car.brand)        # Output: Toyota
print(your_car.model)      # Output: Civic

my_car.start_engine()      # Output: The Toyota Corolla engine has started.
your_car.drive()           # Output: Driving the Honda Civic.

```

### Well made programs

Well-made programs written using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles offer several advantages:

* Modularity and Reusability**: OOP promotes modularity by encapsulating related data (attributes) and behavior (methods) within objects. This modular approach allows code to be organized into smaller, self-contained units, making it easier to understand, maintain, and update. Additionally, OOP encourages code reuse through inheritance and composition, enabling the reuse of existing classes and reducing redundant code.

* Code Organization and Structure**: OOP provides a clear and intuitive structure to programs. Classes serve as blueprints or templates for creating objects, making the code more organized and easier to navigate. This structured approach aids in code readability, comprehension, and collaboration among developers.

* Ease of Maintenance**: OOP promotes code maintainability by localizing changes. Modifications or bug fixes can be applied to specific classes or objects without affecting the entire program. This compartmentalization reduces the risk of unintended consequences and makes it easier to identify and isolate issues.

* Code Extensibility**: OOP supports the principle of inheritance, allowing new classes to inherit attributes and methods from existing classes. This enables the extension and customization of functionality without modifying the original code. By adding new classes and overriding or adding methods, the program can be easily expanded and adapted to new requirements.

* Abstraction and Encapsulation**: OOP allows for abstraction by hiding complex implementation details and exposing only the necessary interface. This abstraction simplifies the understanding and usage of code modules, making them more user-friendly and less error-prone. Encapsulation further enhances abstraction by bundling related data and behavior within objects, protecting the internal state from external interference.

* Polymorphism**: OOP supports polymorphism, which allows objects of different classes to be treated interchangeably through a common interface. Polymorphism enables code to be written to work with generic types and then seamlessly adapt to specific implementations. This flexibility enhances code flexibility, extensibility, and the ability to handle diverse data types or scenarios.

By leveraging these benefits, well-made programs written using OOP principles become more modular, maintainable, extensible, and easier to understand. They facilitate code reuse, collaboration, and scalability, making development and maintenance processes more efficient and effective.# tech241_why_Python
